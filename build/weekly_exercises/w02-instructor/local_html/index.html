			<p>Hi, My name is Jervis Thompson a.k.a <strong><em>Jervo</em></strong></p>
			<p>Even as hardware and software technologies evolve, there are core functional elements and skills that all digital media professionals need to understand in order to thrive. Abstract thinking, logical processes, and strong problem solving skills are essential. These are all tools that a Digital Media degree from Drexel can provide. The biggest challenge to staying current in digital media is to be constantly aware that the best solutions today may not be the best solutions for tomorrow. At Drexel we encourage students to experience, objectively evaluate, and incorporate new solutions as needed. We offer a wide range of study within Digital Media and each professor comes with at least fifteen years of experience. The professors at Drexel know how to evolve with technology, and they challenge students to do the same.</p>

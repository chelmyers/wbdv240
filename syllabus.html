				<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
				<p>Grading is based upon attendance, class participation, homework assignments, class projects, and a final exam.</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html" target="_blank">Attendance is mandatory</a>. Students are expected to attend all classes and strictly adhere to the project due dates. Lack of participation in class discussions will count against your grade.

					Note that an excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student&rsquo;s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or some other serious and important personal circumstance. An absence will be excused only if there is documentation verifying the circumstances that caused the absence.
